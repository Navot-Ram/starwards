# What is this?

Starwards is a space and starship simulator designed specifically for LARPs (Live Action Role-Playing games). Derived from the "Starship Bridge Simulator" genre, Starwards is designed to support long games where the players interact with the ship's system throughout the ship, not just in the bridge.

# how to run and use it

Currently executables are being built after every change. 
click on [this link](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/starwards/starwards?branch=master&filter=build&status=none&status=success), click on the top-most "build" workflow, then on the "build executables" job, then on the "artifacts" tab, and choose the executable that fits your computer. 
download and run it, and open [this link](http://localhost/) in your browser.

This is not a solution we like. We are [open to improvements and suggestions](https://github.com/starwards/starwards/issues/832).

### the game is running! now what?
Missing documentation. contributions are welcomed!

In the "GM" and "empty" screen, the list to the left represents UI widgets that can be *dragged into the main screen*. so you build your own screen. this way each game can have their stations set up the way they want to. later we will support saving the screen presets.
